    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and then write the code to receive an
    inbound <abbr title="Public Switched Telephone Network">PSTN</abbr> call.

    To achieve this, you will need:

    * A web application that will notify the service agent of an inbound call and offer the ability to answer it.
    * A webhook server that can process an inbound webhook and return an <abbr title="Nexmo Call Control Object">NCCO</abbr> to forward the inbound call to your application using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).
