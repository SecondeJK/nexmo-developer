    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create an iOS application using Swift and the Nexmo iOS Client SDK, and then write the code to make a phone call from your iOS app to a phone.

    Two parts are needed to achieve this:

    * An iOS application that will make the voice call using the Client SDK.
    * A publicly accessible URL that serves instructions on how to handle the call. To accomplish this, you will create a webhook server using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel" target="_blank">localtunnel</a>.

    ### Completed project
    If you would like to follow along without building the app yourself, the completed project is available on [Github](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-tutorials) -  please see the [app-to-phone-swift](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-tutorials/tree/main/app-to-phone-swift) folder.

    *This tutorial uses NexmoClient version 3.0.0 and Swift 5*
