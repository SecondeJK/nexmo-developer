    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and write the code to make a
    phone call from your web app to a phone.

    Two parts are needed to achieve this:

    * A web application that will make the voice call using the Client SDK.
    * A publicly accessible URL that serves instructions on how to handle the call. To accomplish this, you will create a webhook server using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel" target="_blank">localtunnel</a>.
