## Getting started

In this example you will need to replace the following variables with actual values using any convenient method:

Key | Description

`VONAGE_API_KEY` | Vonage API key which can be obtained from your [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
`VONAGE_API_SECRET` | Vonage API secret which can be obtained from your [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
`FROM_NUMBER` | A phone number you own or some text to identify the sender.
`TO_NUMBER` | The number of the phone to which the message will be sent.

> **NOTE:** Don't use a leading `+` or `00` when entering a phone number, start with the country code, for example 447700900000.
