# Overview

Vonage Client SDK allows you to build Programmable Conversation applications.

Using the Conversation API and the Client SDK you can build complete applications that feature two-way voice and messaging communications. Whereas the [Conversation API](/conversation/overview) can be used directly to build out the backend of your Programmable Conversation application, the Client SDK enables you to quickly build the client-side application. The backend usually deals with tasks such as managing users in a database, the generation of tokens for those users, and the creation of the [Conversations](/conversation/concepts/conversation). The client-side provides methods to log users into Vonage, and handle the various [Events](/conversation/concepts/event) that are generated as communication takes place. Other client-side functions include generating member invites if required, displaying typing indicators, and handling voice call operations such as inbound call, making a call, a user hanging up, and so on.

Client SDK enables communications across multiple [Channels](/conversation/concepts/channel) including:

* Voice
* SIP
* Websockets
* App

The following media types are supported:

* Messaging
* Voice

The Client SDK supports the following platforms and languages:

Platform | Language
----|----
Web | JavaScript
iOS (10.2 and above) | Objective-C, Swift
Android (6.0 and above - API level 23 and above) | Java, Kotlin

## In-App Messaging

The Client SDK enables you to build a feature-rich chat experience that includes typing indicators and sent, delivered and read receipts.

Some features include:

* Offline Sync – With built-in caching, messages are saved and sent or received once their device is back online.
* Push Notifications – Keep users aware of important alerts by sending notifications to their device.
* Text and Image Support – Users can quickly send and receive texts and images from your application.

## In-App Voice

The Client SDK enables you to build in-app voice features into your application. Vonage In-App Voice uses WebRTC and includes all the essentials you need to build a feature-rich voice experience.

Some features include:

* User Control – Users can control whether their audio stream is muted or unmuted.
* Notifications  – Users can be notified when they receive a call or when participants are muted.
* Group Calls – Configure call settings so users can start a group call by adding participants in real time.

## Concepts

Many of the concepts used in the Client SDK are a result of the design of the [Conversation API](/conversation/overview), which is the underlying technology. The following Concepts will help you use the Client SDK:
