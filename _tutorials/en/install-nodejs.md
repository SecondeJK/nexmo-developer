description: Install node.js as a prerequisite to installing the Vonage CLI

If you want to carry out tasks such as creating applications, purchasing Vonage numbers and so on, you will need to install the Vonage CLI. As the Vonage CLI requires `node.js` you will need to [install `node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) first.

To make sure `node.js` is installed, please run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
node -v
```
